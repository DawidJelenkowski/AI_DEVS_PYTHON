For some reason it never works for the first time, after posting data there is no answer
But if immidietly after stoppingg (ctrl+z) run it again and it works perfectly fine.

### Dependencies
```
I had to install "unstructured[md]"
Plus it works through API so this code may break after an update
If this is the case 
```
```sh
pip install --upgrade openai
pip install --upgrade langchain
```
```
If it still doesn't work read the relevant documentation and fix the code
